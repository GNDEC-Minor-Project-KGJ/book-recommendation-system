<p align="justify">
    A Book Recommendation Engine Based on Collaborative Filtering Concept using K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend book based on the books liked by other readers and their corresponding ratings (ranking system).
</p>
<p align="justify">
     Based on the reading provided by all the readers books are recommended to the users based on the users they follow and their liked books.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The Collaborative Filtering System is established using the cosine similarity relation between ratings and the recommendations with maximum match are returned.
